// GOALS set out for this APP
// Everyone likes IMDB... Now I want to make a little film library database of my own
// This will be a desktop App about movies I own/love/want to watch.
// At the finished Product of this App, the App should be able to:
// * Store data on a new movie
// * Retrieve data on a movie that exists in the library
// * Include search functionality and the ability to edit entries

// You can use Microsoft SQL Server for the database and Visual Studio for the front end. Add in other Amazing features you want
// Maybe I might add a feature that could pull data from IMDB to poppulate my application. 
// Other features could also pull images, movie posters and trailers from the web.

using System.Collections.Generic;

// Don't forget I am using the class System.Collections.Generic namespace because I want my Console App to be able to access Dictionaries in it

class Library{
    static void Main(){
        Console.WriteLine("WELCOME aboard to MY FILM LIBRARY 1.0.1");
        Console.WriteLine("This is an App whose aim is to give you the best when it comes to of Film Libraries");
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine();

        // Currently as at today: 1st of March 2023, my C# learning hasn't gotten me yet to databases But I would try as 
        // much as possible to replicate one(mock one based on my understanding)
